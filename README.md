# Hi! Welcome to my GitHub.ðŸ˜‹

My name is ZoÃ« Klapman. I am just starting my career in tech in Silicon Valley. I recently graduated summa cum laude from Monmouth University, where I earned a BS in computer science and played D1 women's tennis.

During my college life, I was a student athlete where I worked in a balance of academic and athletics. Being an athlete was a full-time job, where my days were full of practice, lift, and traveling for matches. Now as a retired athlete, that time is replaced with my official full-time job as a software engineer.

After office hours is my opportunity to explore more technical curiosities and create projects that peak my interest. My open-source projects are here, and all of my notable projects can be found on my website <a href="http://www.zoedotdot.com/" target="_blank"> Zoedotdot </a>.
